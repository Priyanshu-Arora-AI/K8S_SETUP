scenario where we create a single Kubernetes Job YAML file (job.yaml) that runs three pods concurrently, each with a different value for the DATA environment variable:
In this scenario:

We have a single Kubernetes Job named data-processing-job.
The parallelism field specifies that three pods should run concurrently.
The completions field ensures that the job is considered successful only when all three pods complete successfully.
Each pod is based on the same template (data-processing-pod), which contains a single container named data-processor.
The container uses the image your-data-processor-image:tag, which should contain the code to process the data.
We pass the data to each pod via the DATA environment variable.
The value for the DATA environment variable is sourced from a ConfigMap named data-configmap, using the key data-value.
Now, we need to create the ConfigMap that contains the different data values:

In this ConfigMap:

data1, data2, and data3 are keys representing different data values.
"value1", "value2", and "value3" are the corresponding data values.
Apply the ConfigMap and the Job YAML:

This will create a single Kubernetes Job that runs three pods concurrently, each pod receiving a different data value via the DATA environment variable sourced from the ConfigMap.
